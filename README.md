# Convergence mxGraph Demonstration
This project demonstrates collaborative diagram editing using the [mxGraph](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph) open source diagraming framework. This example is based off of the [Graph Editor Example] that comes with mxGraph. It has been extended and integrated with Convergence to provide realtime editing, shared cursors, shared selection, and viewport awareness. The example also leverages Convergence to provide a participant list and a chat room per diagram.
